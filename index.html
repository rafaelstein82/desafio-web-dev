            <p>
                A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my
                entire soul, hke these sweet mornings of spring which
                I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel
                the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
                for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my
                dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
                tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should
                be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present
                moment ; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
                artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems
                with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes
                the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my
                trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass
                by the trickling stream ; and, as I lie close to the earth,
                a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me : when
                I hear the buzz of the httle world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
                of the insects and fhes, then I feel the presence of the
                Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains
                us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss ; and
                then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes,
                and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and
                absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress,
                — then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper
                all that is hving so full and warm within me, that it
                might be the mirror of my soul, as ray soul is the 
                mirror of the infinite God ! 0 my friend — but it is
                too much for my strength — I sink under the weight
                of the splendour of these visions !
                </p>
                <p>May 12.</p>
                <p>
                I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt
                this spot, or whether it be the warm, celestial fancy
                in my own heart which makes everything around me
                seem hke paradise. In front of the house is a fountain,— a fountain to which I am bound by a charm like Melusina and her sisters. Descending a gentle
                slope, you come to an arch, where, some twenty steps
                lower dowTi, water of the clearest crystal gushes from the marble rock. The narrow wall which encloses it
                above, the tall trees which encircle the spot, and the
                coolness of the place itself, — everything imparts a pleasant but sublime impression. Not a day passes
                on which I do not spend an hour there. The young
                maidens come from the town to fetch water, — innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the
                occupation of the daughters of kings. As I take my
                rest there, the idea of the old patriarchal life is awak- ened around me. I see them, our old ancestors, how
                they formed their friendships and contracted alhances
                at the fountain-side ; and I feel how fountains and
                streams were guarded by beneficent spirits. He who
                is a stranger to these sensations has never really en- joyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the
                fatigue of a weary summer day.

                <p>May 13.</p>
                <p>
                You ask if you shall send me books. My dear friend,
                I beseeth you, for the love of God, relieve me from
                such a yoke ! I need no more to be guided, agitated,
                heated. My heart ferments sufficiently of itself. I
                want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection
                in my Homer. Often do I strive to allay the burning 

                fever of my blood ; and you have never witnessed any- tliing so unsteady, so uncertain, as my heart. But
                need I confess this to you, my dear friend, who have
                so often endured the anguish of witnessing my sudden
                transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from
                sweet melancholy to violent passions ? I treat my
                poor heart like a sick child, and gratify its every fancy.
                Do not mention this again : there are people who would censure me for it.
                <p>May 15.</p>
                <p>
                The common people of the place know me already,
                and love me, particularly the children. When at first
                I associated with them, and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some fancied that I wished
                to ridicule them, and turned from me in exceeding ill- humour. I did not allow that circumstance to grieve
                me : I only felt most keenly what I have often before
                observed. Persons who can claim a certain rank keep
                themselves coldly aloof from the common people, as
                though they feared to lose their importance by the
                contact ; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone
                to bad joking, affect to descend to their level, only to
                make the poor people feel their impertinence all the
                more keenly.
                </p>
                <p>
                I know very well that we are not all equal, nor can
                be so ; but it is my opinion that he who avoids the
                common people, in order not to lose their respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hides himself from his
                enemy because he fears defeat.
                </p>
                <p>
                The other day I went to the fountain, and found a
                young servant-girl, who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to see if one of her
                companions was approaching to place it on her head.
                I ran down, and looked at her. " Shall I help you,
                pretty lass ? " said I. She blushed deeply. " Oh, sir ! "
                she exclaimed. " No ceremony ! " I replied. She adjusted 
                her head-gear, and I helped her. She thanked me, and ascended the steps.
                </p>
                <p>May 17.</p>
                <p>
                I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as
                yet found no society. I know not what attraction I
                possess for the people, so many of them like me, and
                attach themselves to me ; and then I feel sorry when
                the road we pursue together goes only a short distance.
                </p>
                <p>   
                If you inquire what the people are like here, I must
                answer, " The same as everywhere." The human race is but a monotonous affair. Most of them labour the
                greater part of their time for mere subsistence ; and
                the scanty portion of freedom wliich remains to them
                so troubles them that they use every exertion to get
                rid of it. Oh, the destiny of man !
                </p> 
                <p>
                But they are a right good sort of people. If I occasionally forget myself, and take part in the innocent
                pleasures which are not yet forbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, with genuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, or
                arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so
                forth, all this produces a good effect upon my disposition ;• only I must forget that there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which moulder uselessly,
                and which I am obHged to keep carefully concealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ah ! this thought affects my spirits fearfully. And yet to be misunderstood is the fate of the like of us.
                Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone ! Alas,
                that I ever knew her ! I might say to myself, " You are a dreamer to seek what is not to be found here
                below." But she has been mine. I have possessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemed
                to be more than I really was, because I was all that I
                could be. Good heavens ! did then a single power of
                my soul remain imexercised ? In her presence could I 
                not display, to its full extent, that mysterious feeling
                with which my heart embraces nature ? Was not our
                intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of
                the keenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their
                very eccentricity, bore the stamp of genius ? Alas !
                the few years by which she was my senior brought her
                to the grave before me. Never can I forget her firm
                mind or her heavenly patience.
